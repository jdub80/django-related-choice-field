Django Linked Choice Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disclaimer: This is work in progress and needs some improvements to get to
a production ready state.


This field is an extention of Django ModelChoiceField to reflect a
ForeignKey or ManyToManyField relation.

The demo application will let you choose a book that belongs to an author.
Just select the author and you'll see the list of books will adapt to the
selected author.

See the bugtracker on the features that needs to be worked on.
